# cancer-detection-ml

**Machine learning project to classify tumors as malignant or benign using Python and Scikit-learn.**
Model used:- Gaussian Naive Bayes.

This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to cancer detection using a structured dataset. It focuses on classifying tumors into benign or malignant categories by analyzing various input features using supervised learning algorithms.
